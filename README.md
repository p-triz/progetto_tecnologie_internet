# Online Game Platform

## Dependecies
* install node
* install python

* npm install
* npm i react-router-dom
* npm i axios

* pip3 install flask
* pip3 install Flask-Cors


## How to run the code
inside the backend folder you need to execute in the terminal:
* flask initdb (to initialize the database)
* python3 app.py (to run the server)

Now inside the frontend folder you need to execute in the terminal:
* npm run dev

## How it works
Once you've logged in you can play few games and see the scoreboard of those games.
The frontend (done with ReactJS) communicates with the backend (written in Flask Python) to send and receive data that are stored into a MySql database (SQLite3).
